# Digital Animation

### APS Course Code: 28457

Students gain experiences related to computer animation by using graphics and design concepts. Students solve problems involving 2D and 3D object manipulation, storyboarding, texturing/mapping, lighting concepts, and environmental geometry. Students create a variety of animations that reflect real-world applications and are introduced to interactive and 3D animation software. Production of a portfolio showcasing examples of original student work is included.

**Note** The program of studies states that this course must be taken concurrently with Graphic Communications Systems - this is not true. Students can take either class or both. Taking both classes counts as an elective sequence.
