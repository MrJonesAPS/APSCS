# Graphic Communications System

### APS Course Code: 28458

Graphic Communications System focuses on creating computer graphic designs for display on the World Wide Web. Students acquire knowledge regarding the difference between Web graphics and print graphics. Through class projects, students create work using a variety of image-making software. By developing quality art images, students learn the highly transferable skills of visual communication. These skills are increasingly in demand in our web-connected world. Students create a professional digital portfolio of completed work.

**Note** The program of studies states that this course must be taken concurrently with Graphic Communications Systems - this is not true. Students can take either class or both. Taking both classes counts as an elective sequence.
